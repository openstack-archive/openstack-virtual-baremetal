# title: Enable Routed Networks IPv6
# description: |
#   Enable use of routed IPv6 networks, where there may be multiple separate
#   networks connected with a router, router advertisement daemon (radvd),
#   and DHCP relay. Do not pass any other network configuration environments
#   after this one or they may override the changes made by this environment.
#   When this environment is in use, the routed-networks-configuration
#   environment should usually be included as well.
